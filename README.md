# Simple Task Manager
Simple Task Manager is a React based web application that holds a todo list for a user. It features creation, editing, and deletion of tasks, as well as tracks which tracks are completed and the total number of tasks completed.

## Access
Simple Task Manager is accessible on GitHub Pages, located here: <link>

## Installation
Simple Task Manager can also be run locally via npm. Installation instructions are simple:
<br />
- clone repo to desired folder
- run npm install to install dependencies
- run npm start to run the program, it should open in a web browser

## Upcoming Features
- **Memory:** While this would require migration from GitHub pages, I would like to add memory to the application so that is can be used to store to-do lists between sessions.
